- Fortran comipler support OpenMP
- GNU Make

[Usage]
1. Edit Makefile
   For gfortran,       FC = gfortran
   For Intel Fortran,  FC = ifx
   For NVIDIA HPC SDK, FC = nvfortran
   In case of Microsoft windows, please set 
     RM = del
     CP = copy /y

2. Edit OPTION_*
   For gfortran,       please edit OPTION_gfortran
   For INTEL Fortran,  please edit OPTION_ifx
   For NVIDIA HPC SDK, please edit OPTION_nvfortran

3. Build executables
   make clean
   make

4. Run the shell script (Results of ng_*.exe may vary in each run. )
