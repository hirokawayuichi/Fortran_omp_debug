_/_/_/ Fortran Debug Sample Code Using OpenMP ver.1 _/_/_/
Written by Y.Hirokawa

[Overview]
Parallelization using OpenMP often reveal the bug of code. 
These examples show the bug related to local vaiables: unitialized, update randomly and other factors.  
While ok.f90 has no bug, ng.f90 has bugs. 

If your OpenMP code generates results different from sequential code 
in case of single thread (or just link openmp library), 
please check local variables state of subroutine or function. 


[Prerequesties]
- Fortran comipler supports OpenMP
- GNU Make


[Usage]
1. Edit Makefile
   For gfortran,       FC = gfortran
   For Intel Fortran,  FC = ifx
   For NVIDIA HPC SDK, FC = nvfortran
   In case of Microsoft windows, please set 
     RM = del
     CP = copy /y

2. Edit OPTION_*
   For gfortran,       please edit OPTION_gfortran
   For INTEL Fortran,  please edit OPTION_ifx
   For NVIDIA HPC SDK, please edit OPTION_nvfortran

3. Build executables
   make clean
   make

4. Run the shell script (Results of ng_*.exe may vary in each run. ) 
  sh ./go.sh
